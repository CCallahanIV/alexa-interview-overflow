Gathering user-generated interview questions and answers for our Alexa interview skill(s).

## Setup the Alexa Skills
You can add all of our interview skills, like so:

* "Alexa, add the InterviewTips skill."
* "Alexa, add the InterviewQuiz skill."
* "Alexa, add the BehaviorInterview skill."
* "Alexa, add the TechnicalInterview skill."
* "Alexa, add the TextMyPartner skill."

OR - you can go to the [Alexa Skills page](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=13727921011) and download the skills from there.

You can download the [Alexa App on your phone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602060) as well.

If you do not have a Dot, Echo, or Tap, you can you [echoism.io](https://echosim.io/) instead. It's free to use Alexa itself. 

You can also create a piece of hardware via adding [Alexa to a RaspberryPi](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/wiki/Raspberry-Pi).
